Domotiikka
==========

Open Source domotic system for the RaspberryPi.

The main goal here, is to create from zero, the basic platform for those who wants to initiate their "domotic adventures".

Our system should be able to be integrated with all common sensors and actuators in the "Real World".


The basic features are:

* Integration with Arduino.
* Integration with RaspberryPi.
* Minimal hardware requirements.
* Very low cost.
* Secure remote access.
* Fully customizable.
* Easy implementation.


Future features:

* Android native application.
* iOS native application.
* RealTime monitoring Log.
* Facebook / Twitter / Google+ integration.



How to start:
* Connect and start your RaspberryPi
* Install WiringPi from here http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/
* Restart your Apache and test it by doing "sudo service apache2 restart"
* Copy the two files (domotiikka.php and mScript.js) to your /var/www (Where Apache files are located)
* Copy your RaspberryPiÂ´s IP, for example typing "ifconfig" on the terminal.
* Open a browser from your own computer, and type in the IP address of the Raspberry Pi, followed by domotiikka.php. 
* By clicking on the two buttons you are putting high/low level in the pin number 5 of your RaspberryPi using your local network.

Domotiikka is the Finnish word to refer to home automation. 

It is my appreciation of the good times in that country during my Degree Project in Oulun Yliopisto (University of Oulu, Finland).
